# What is this?

The only sensible iOS flashlight app known to me. Took just a few hours to develop, including researching needed API and testing. How hard can it be? Features include:

* Super-fast load time
* Launch image is a white fill, so it's actually useful even before binary has loaded
* Lights up the LED if available on the device
* No "Off" switch. You have Home button for that
* No "On" switch either. You have app icon on home screen for that
* Prevents autosleep. Will run until battery's flat
* Handles multitasking
* Also works on iPad (although isn't as handy as an iPhone)

# How to install?

You need an iOS Developer subscription, or a fellow iOS developer to build this app for you.

# Why the hell?

And why the hell there's nothing close to usable in the AppStore? This was my attempt to solve the problem of absence of a sensible damn flashlight app in the iOS AppStore.

One night i needed to change a bulb in my car's headlight, and i ended up downloading a bunch of flashlight apps from the AppStore. All of them sucked. Problems i encountered included:

* Long startup time. To the point i couldn't turn LED on until ads got loaded
* On/Off switch. Kept turning it off trying to grip the phone
* In many apps On/Off switch was bugging out and crashing app after multitasking (like incoming call)
* Autosleep kicked in right after i placed it nicely under the bonnet of the car
* Ads. Kept clicking on them accidentially quitting the app
* Useless features. Just do one feature well, you enterprise morons!
* Price. I'm not paying for this

Should i mention again, that all these problems left me in the dark.

# Why on GitHub? Why not in AppStore?

Apple's reviewers answered "we have enough flashlight apps already". Nuff said.
